=============

[A much more fully-featured legend has been created by Susie Lu](https://github.com/susielu/d3-legend)

A simple and draggable legend created from d3 scales. You can see [an example here](http://bl.ocks.org/mpschr/129c671ee44a417c417e). Legends have the following options:

legend.**inputScale**(d3.scale)
Associates the legend with a d3 scale. Currently only tested with threshold and ordinal scales.

legend.**cellWidth**(*number*)
The width in pixels of each legend cell.

legend.**cellHeight**(*number*)
The height in pixels of each legend cell.

legend.**cellPadding**(*number*)
The padding in pixels of each legend cell.

legend.**units**(*string*)
The name of the units represented by the legend.

legend.**orientation**(*["horizontal","vertical"]*)
Determines whether the legend is presented horizontally or vertically. See example for the difference. Defaults to horizontal.

legend.**labelFormat**(*d3.format*)
Sets the formatter for the units. Set to "none" if you want no formatter applied, otherwise pass a d3.format with the settings you want.

legend.**place**(*{x: 0, y:0}*)
Sets the initial position. Default: {x:0, y:0}. Legend is draggable thereafter
